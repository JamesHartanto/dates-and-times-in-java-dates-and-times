            In this main() method you should make use of your SignificantDate
            class. Use the next() method to find and print the next instance of
            and number of days to three dates:

            - One of the holiday constants defined in SignificantDate (not Leap Year)
            - Leap Year
            - Any other arbitrary date

            Here is some valid example output:

            There are 354 days until the next occurrence of Christmas on 12/25/2017
            There are 1150 days until the next occurrence of Leap Year on 2/29/2020
            There are 338 days until the next occurrence of my birthday on 12/9/2017

            Be sure to use the DateTimeFormatter class to format the date
            correctly. The date is in the form of month/day/year, without any
            leading zeros on the month or day. For example, February is 2, not
            02.

            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html

            To create a DateTimeFormatter you must use the ofPattern() method to
            establish the pattern/format to create.

            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#ofPattern-java.lang.String-

            The syntax for defining patterns is documented here:

            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns

            Once you have your DateTimeFormatter you can use the format() method
            to convert a LocalDate (or any other representation of time in the
            java.time package).
